# ðŸš€ Pathfinding-Visualiser

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualiser! I built this web-based application because I was always fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and always wanted to visualise them in action.

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms:

- [x] Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [x] A-Star (A*) Algorithm

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): The father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path.

**A-Star (A\*) Algorithm** (weighted): Arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.
