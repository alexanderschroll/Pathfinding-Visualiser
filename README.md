# Pathfinding-Visualiser

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualiser! I built this web-based application because I was always fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and always wanted to visualise them in action.

## Meet the Algorithms

This application will support the following algorithms:

- [x] Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [ ] Greedy Best-first Search
- [ ] Swarm Algorithm
- [ ] Convergent Swarm Algorithm
- [ ] Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm
- [ ] Breath-first Search
- [ ] Depth-first Search
