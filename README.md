# ðŸš€ Pathfinding-Visualiser

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualiser! I built this web-based application because I was always fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and always wanted to visualise them in action.

## Meet the Algorithms

This application will support the following algorithms:

- [x] Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [x] Greedy Best-first Search
- [x] Swarm Algorithm
- [x] Convergent Swarm Algorithm
- [x] Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm
- [x] Breath-first Search
- [x] Depth-first Search
